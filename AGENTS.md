# AGENTS.md

This document describes operating rules for AI coding agents (Codex, Cursor, and similar tools) working in this repository. The maintainer does not need to follow it as a checklist; durable product rules live in `README.md`, `README.ja.md`, and the documents under `docs/`.

This repository is the development repository for `winproc-tui`.
`winproc-tui` is a TUI process investigation tool for Windows 11 x64. It uses Rust 2024 edition, ratatui, crossterm, Windows APIs, PDH, DXGI, and sysinfo.

## Read Before Working

This repository has specifications under `docs/`. Before changing implementation or explanations, read the documents relevant to the requested work.

- `docs/architecture.md`: System-wide responsibility boundaries, runtime data flow, and cross-cutting design decisions.
- `docs/tracking-and-history.md`: Tracking intent, process identity, named lists, Ghost Rows, and Live-history retention.
- `docs/graph-workspace.md`: Graph identity, shared time and A/B state, Samples, ordering, and responsive layout.
- `docs/process-investigation.md`: System Info, Process Info, Files, DLLs, Environment, and asynchronous target safety.
- `docs/recording-and-log-view.md`: Live / Recording / Log-view transitions, session ownership, failures, and log loading.
- `docs/metrics.md`: Metrics, data sources, display formats, CPU% semantics, sampling frequency, aggregation, and recording schemas.
- `docs/dotnet-metrics-collection.md`: .NET diagnostics IPC, EventPipe parsing, fallbacks, and runtime-specific collection details.
- `docs/schemas/README.md`: Machine-readable recording-schema artifacts and their synchronization rules.
- `docs/release-workflow.md`: Release tagging, packaging, and GitHub Release procedure.
- `README.ja.md`: Japanese user-facing overview.
- `README.md`: English user-facing overview for GitHub. Keep it synchronized with `README.ja.md`.

Prefer the current implementation under `src/` over old notes or guesses.
If the specifications and implementation conflict, inspect the implementation first and update the specifications if needed.

## Repository Policy

- Store text files as UTF-8 without BOM, using LF line endings. Keep this aligned with `.gitattributes`.
- This project is Windows-only. Do not add abstractions or explanations that assume Linux / macOS support unless explicitly requested.
- This is a personal project. Unsolicited pull requests from external contributors are not accepted. Use GitHub Issues for feedback and feature requests.
- `docs/` is Git-managed primary information for specifications, architecture, metrics, and release workflow. When implementation or specifications change, update the related documents in the same work item.
- `logs/` and `notes/` are local-only paths ignored by `.gitignore`. Do not treat them as publishable artifacts unless the user explicitly says so.
- Local-only work that changes only ignored paths such as `notes/` or `logs/` does not require an agent branch or commit.
- Existing uncommitted changes may be user work. Do not revert changes you did not make.
- Keep changes as small as practical. Avoid opportunistic large refactors and unrelated formatting churn.
- Do not include maintainer-specific absolute filesystem paths or usernames in Git-managed documentation, public Issue bodies, commit messages, or other publishable text. Use repository-relative paths or role-based placeholders such as `<main-worktree>` and `<worktree-root>`.
- Keep maintained specifications under `docs/` in English.
- Keep Japanese documentation limited to `README.ja.md` unless the user explicitly asks otherwise.
- In `README.ja.md`, prefer natural, readable Japanese over literal translation or unnecessary English mixing.
- The GitHub Release zip is runtime-only. Package `winproc-tui.exe` and the `LICENSE` distribution notice, but do not package README files, `assets/`, `docs/`, or a preset `winproc-tui.toml`. The application creates or updates its user-specific config next to the real executable after a successful run.
- Release builds for `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` must statically link the Microsoft C runtime. Do not package or publish an executable that imports runtime DLLs such as `VCRUNTIME140.dll` or `api-ms-win-crt-*.dll`.

## Documentation Workflow

- In general, work on the change requested by the user. If the user selects a GitHub Issue, work on exactly that one issue.
- Before implementing, read the target issue or request and related specifications. Do not mix requirements, design, and implementation instructions.
- If metrics, data sources, display formats, aggregation, or recording fields change, update `docs/metrics.md`. When the schema-v3 record shape or positional arrays change, update `docs/schemas/recording-v3-line.schema.json` and its parity tests in the same work item.
- If system-wide responsibility boundaries, runtime flow, or cross-cutting design decisions change, update `docs/architecture.md`.
- If Tracking List, process-identity, Ghost Row, or Live-history behavior changes, update `docs/tracking-and-history.md`.
- If Graph, Samples, A/B, ordering, or workspace-layout state changes, update `docs/graph-workspace.md`.
- If System Info or Process Info collection and lifecycle behavior changes, update `docs/process-investigation.md`.
- If Recording, log loading, or Log-view lifecycle changes, update `docs/recording-and-log-view.md`.
- If user-facing behavior changes, update Help, Footer, tests, source, and the README only when positioning, installation, first-use workflow, or a major visible capability is affected.
- Keep exact key lists, colors, emphasis, cell widths, marker shapes, focus order, and drawing positions in Help, Footer, implementation, and tests rather than expanding design documents with rendering details.
- If release contents, packaging checks, tagging, or publishing steps change, update `scripts/package-release.ps1` and `docs/release-workflow.md` together.
- After implementation, perform a documentation-impact check and update only the canonical owners affected by the change in the same work item.
- If a technical choice needs durable context, keep it in the related specification, architecture document, or GitHub Issue.
- Do not create or update repository-local backlog files under `docs/backlog/`; use GitHub Issues for backlog tracking.

## Commit Rules

- Use English Conventional Commits for commit messages.
- Every commit must include a concise commit message body that summarizes the changes so readers can understand what changed when reviewing the commit history.
- Keep commits scoped. Do not include unrelated dirty files or local-only artifacts.
- When a coherent unit of AI work is complete, commit it promptly.
- Do not commit ignored local-only files such as `notes/` or `logs/` unless the user explicitly asks to track them.
- When committing implementation work, include updates to the affected canonical documentation in the same commit. Do not change design documents mechanically when their owned behavior is unaffected.
- When work is covered by a GitHub Issue, reference that Issue in the commit message or maintainer-requested pull request.
- Disambiguate GitHub item numbers in human-facing text and commit titles: write `Issue #n` for Issues and `PR #n` for pull requests. Avoid a bare `#n` except where GitHub syntax requires it, such as `Closes #n` or `Refs #n`.

## Branch Workflow Rules

These branch / commit / push rules apply to AI agents. The maintainer usually integrates work locally; open a pull request only when the maintainer explicitly asks for one.

- Treat `main` as the stable default branch. Do not use it for experiments or multi-step work.
- AI agents must work on an `agent/<short-topic>` branch for tracked repository changes.
- Prefer a branch name that describes the work, for example `agent/help-dialog-copy` or `agent/branch-workflow-docs`.
- If the human gives a branch name, use the human-specified name instead of inventing one.
- Use `agent/YYYYMMDD-HHMM` only as a fallback when there is no clear topic name or when the human explicitly asks for a timestamp-only branch.
- AI agents must not commit to `main` unless the user explicitly instructs them to do so.
- Create an independent agent branch from the current local `main`. Start from another branch only when the user explicitly names that base or when the task explicitly continues an existing agent branch.
- If the task only creates or updates ignored local-only files such as `notes/` or `logs/`, stay on the current branch and do not create an agent branch.
- Humans may review one or more AI commits together, ask for fixes on the same agent branch, then squash merge to `main` with one English summary commit.
- After an agent branch has been squash merged to `main`, remove its completed clean worktree and delete the branch immediately. Apply the same verified cleanup when the user decides to discard the work.
- Do not force-push or rewrite published `main`.
- AI agents must not push `main` unless the user explicitly asks to push.

## Worktree Workflow Rules

- Keep the canonical `main` worktree in the repository's primary checkout directory. Treat its concrete absolute path as local environment state rather than publishable documentation content.
- Place manually managed linked worktrees under a sibling `<worktree-root>\<issue-or-topic>` directory outside the repository worktree. Because this path is outside the main worktree, it does not require a `.gitignore` entry.
- Do not create manually managed worktrees under `notes/`, `target/`, or another subdirectory of a repository worktree. Nested worktrees can be affected by repository cleanup and make recursive searches and status inspection ambiguous.
- Before creating a worktree, confirm the exact Issue or topic, branch name, target path, current `git worktree list`, and intended base commit. The target path and branch must not already be assigned to another worktree.
- Use an attached `agent/<short-topic>` branch for tracked implementation work. Detached worktrees are limited to read-only inspection or temporary verification and must not become the only location of uncommitted implementation work.
- When Issues overlap in shared state, input handling, layout, or other semantic ownership, use one active implementation worktree at a time. Parallel worktrees do not make semantically conflicting changes independent.
- Treat Codex-managed worktrees separately from manually managed worktrees. Confirm the owning task before moving or removing one manually.
- Before removing a worktree, confirm its exact path, branch or detached HEAD, status, and ownership. Preserve tracked and untracked work unless the user explicitly asks to discard it.
- Remove a completed clean worktree before deleting its branch. Do not use `git worktree remove --force` for routine cleanup. After squash integration, force-delete the source branch only after proving that it has no intended content missing from `main`.
- Use `git worktree prune` only for stale administrative entries after checking `git worktree prune --dry-run`; it is not a substitute for reviewing and removing a live worktree.
- If Windows locks a worktree after validation or commit, inspect the exact process and wait for Git maintenance or repack to finish naturally. Do not kill Terminal or unrelated user processes.
- If the existing checkout does not match this layout, do not relocate or remove dirty worktrees merely to enforce the policy. Report the mismatch and obtain approval for the exact migration.

## Main Integration Rules

These rules apply when the user asks an AI agent to integrate a completed agent branch into `main`.

- Before integrating an agent branch into `main`, confirm the related GitHub Issue number when the work requires or already has an Issue.
- Prefer squash-merging completed agent branch work into `main` as one coherent English Conventional Commit.
- When the squash merge corresponds to a GitHub Issue, append the issue number to the commit title as `(Issue #n)`, for example `fix: place graph a/b labels on x-axis (Issue #3)`, so `git log --oneline` remains easy to scan without confusing the Issue number with a PR number.
- If the work completes a GitHub Issue, include `Closes #n` in the commit body. Use `Refs #n` instead if the Issue should remain open.
- A typical local integration sequence, run against the canonical `main` worktree, is:

```powershell
git -C <main-worktree> status --short --branch
git -C <main-worktree> merge --squash agent/<short-topic>
git -C <main-worktree> commit -m "<message> (Issue #n)" -m "Closes #n"
```

- Pushing `main` is normally performed by the user. AI agents must not run `git push origin main` unless the user explicitly asks them to push.

## Issue Workflow Rules

- GitHub Issues are the backlog and status-management surface.
- Follow the canonical [Development Issue Policy](CONTRIBUTING.md#development-issue-policy) in `CONTRIBUTING.md` when deciding whether work requires an Issue. Commit count, file count, and implementation size are not reasons to omit one.
- Before implementing work that requires an Issue, search open and closed Issues for an existing match. If none exists, obtain maintainer approval to create one unless Issue creation was already explicitly requested.
- If initially Issue-free work expands into a category that requires an Issue, stop before implementing the expanded scope and create or select the Issue first.
- If the maintainer explicitly requests an Issue-free exception, do not create an Issue or add `Refs` or `Closes` references.
- Write GitHub Issue titles and bodies in English.
- Use only two issue types: Bug report and Feature request.
- Issue templates are intentionally light. At minimum, a goal or a description of what is broken is required. Background, scope, acceptance criteria, and test plan are optional and can be added when implementation actually starts or in related commits on the agent branch.
- Use `Refs #n` in intermediate agent-branch commits. Use `Closes #n` only in the final commit that completes the Issue on the default branch.
- Keep complete controls and contextual behavior in Help, Footer, tests, and source. Keep the README focused on positioning, installation, first-use workflows, and major capabilities. Route durable design behavior to the owning document under `docs/`, and keep agent-facing invariants in this file.
- Issue discussion, triage, labels, and status changes do not require repository commits by themselves.
- Do not reintroduce `docs/backlog/index.md` or `docs/backlog/BL-xxx.md` unless the user explicitly reverses this policy.

## GitHub CLI Authentication

- A failed `gh auth status` inside the Codex Sandbox does not prove that the maintainer's GitHub CLI credentials are invalid. The Sandbox user may be unable to access credentials stored for the host user in Windows Credential Manager.
- Do not ask the maintainer to run `gh auth login` based only on an authentication failure inside the Sandbox.
- When authenticated `gh` access is required, verify it outside the Sandbox with `gh auth status --hostname github.com` and run the necessary `gh` command outside the Sandbox so it can reuse the host user's existing credentials.
- Ask the maintainer to log in again only when the host-side authentication check also reports that authentication is missing or invalid.
- Do not copy a token from the host keyring into repository files, command output, or plaintext configuration as a workaround for Sandbox isolation.

## Implementation Guide

- Keep `model` as a data layer that does not depend on UI or samplers.
- Prefer keeping sampling non-blocking for the UI. Do not place heavy collection work on the UI thread.
- When adding a metric, check at least `model::columns`, `model::snapshot` / `process`, `samplers`, `ui::format`, display tables, Details, and recording logs.
- `CPU%` is a percentage of total logical CPU capacity. Read PDH `\Process(*)\% Processor Time` with `PDH_FMT_NOCAP100`, then divide by the logical CPU count.
- Unavailable values should generally be displayed as `--` in the UI and omitted from recording logs rather than written as `null`.
- The config file is `winproc-tui.toml`. Resolve command links and filesystem aliases before selecting its location beside the real executable. If an older launcher-adjacent config exists and the real executable has none, move the old file before loading it. It saves session state on exit and restores it on the next launch.
- Do not save Filter input state to the config file.
- Treat `tracked_only` as an independent state. Do not infer it from whether the Tracking List is non-empty.
- Treat the Tracking List as a field of the mutable Current Investigation, not as an independently named object. Investigation Profiles are the only named reusable definitions and change only through explicit Save, Save As, Rename, or Delete actions.
- When startup mode requires an investigation choice, apply its tracking intent before the initial sample so tracked-history retention applies from the first capture, then resolve Graph templates against that sample.

## User-Facing Behavior Rules

- The app has three user-visible activities: `Live`, `Recording`, and `Log view`.
- `Live` displays live snapshots from the sampling worker.
- `Recording` displays live snapshots and appends them to a JSON Lines recording session.
- `Log view` shows the last process snapshot and recorded metric histories from a saved log; it does not play frames over time.
- The header labels these activities as `LIVE`, `REC`, and `LOG`.
- Live and Recording show no normal freshness text. At 3 seconds without a successfully applied sample, the header adds `STALE Ns` until another sample succeeds.
- `DISPLAY PAUSED` freezes only the displayed snapshot. Sampling and Recording continue, and display pause is unavailable in Log view.
- `Recording` and `Log view` are mutually exclusive.
- Starting recording requires at least one configured Tracking List entry.
- Recording may start even when no configured tracked name currently matches a live process; frames still record system metrics and use an empty `processes` array until a matching process appears.
- Starting recording must copy the working Tracking List into session-owned recording scope. Session metadata, every frame's `tracked_names`, and process filtering must use that fixed copy.
- Recording aggregation is session-owned and selectable as `1s`, `2s`, `5s`, or `10s`; Live collection and Live history remain fixed at one second.
- Aggregated Recording frames average only available values, keep process identities independent, use the final sample timestamp, and flush a partial final window before an explicit stop, quit, or the 24-hour limit.
- While Recording is active, `t` and tracking-cell `Space` must reject Tracking List changes with a visible notice. `Ctrl+T` still opens Investigation Profiles, but saving or loading investigation state is unavailable; rename and delete remain allowed. `Shift+T` remains available because it changes only the independent Tracked-only display.
- Recording is unavailable in Log view, and Log view is unavailable during Recording.
- `Ctrl+R` during Recording must open a stop confirmation where `Enter`, `Esc`, or `n` continues and `y` stops; sampling and recording continue until Stop is confirmed.
- Stopping recording must write the end record, flush, and close the recording log.
- A recording session lasts for at most 24 hours. At the limit, write the clean end record, flush and close the log, dismiss recording-only dialogs, and automatically return to Live.
- Quitting during recording must flush the recording log before exit. A cleanup failure cancels quit.
- Recording create, write, and flush failures must open a visible error dialog. Keep partial logs and never rely only on transient status text for these failures.
- In Log view, returning to Live must not be confused with quitting the app.
- The header should make the active activity visible without adding noisy explanatory text.
- Open Files is an explicit per-process investigation action. It lists disk files currently open by the selected live process.
- Open Files is not a general handle explorer for pipes, sockets, registry keys, events, mutexes, or every possible Windows handle type.
- Open-file collection must not block the UI thread. Refreshing the list should be explicit and should not queue redundant refresh work for the same modal session.
- Process Info tabs must keep the `ProcessIdentity` fixed when the dialog opens. Image, Files, DLL, and Environment worker results must also match the current dialog generation so stale results cannot update a reopened dialog.
- DLL enumeration and file metadata collection must stay on its independent worker and occur only on initial tab activation or explicit refresh, never in normal sampling.
- Environment remote-memory reads must stay on their independent worker, enforce the 4 MiB limit, never enter recording/export data, and never expose values through status or error text.
- Log view must not start live Process Info Image, Files, DLL, or Environment collection. Dynamic tabs display their not-recorded state inside the shared Process Info dialog.
- Loading an Investigation Profile may prune older retained history for names removed from the working Tracking List. Confirm before discarding those older samples.

## UI / UX Guide

- Keep the TUI compact and low-noise. Do not add unnecessary borders, spacing, explanatory text, or decoration.
- Keep clipboard output raw and minimal so it can be pasted as-is. Do not add unnecessary headers or explanations.
- Modal dialogs do not render action buttons such as OK, Cancel, Close, Start, or Refresh. Put footer-style shortcut guidance on the dialog's bottom row, keep at least one blank row between dialog content and that guidance, and do not add a horizontal separator. Preserve the semantic shortcut colors instead of using a brighter color as the only separator.
- `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` cycles only real controls inside a dialog, such as lists, text fields, tabs, interactive content, and radio groups. Passive Process Info content on Metrics and Image is not a focus stop. Mouse input remains available for direct manipulation of controls, scrollbars, and list rows.
- Confirmation keys are action-specific and must match the dialog footer. Quit uses `Enter` or `q` to quit and `Esc` to cancel; retained-history removal uses `Enter` to remove and `Esc` to cancel; process kill uses `Enter` to kill and `Esc` to cancel, with no `y` or `n` binding. Recording Stop retains its explicit `y` confirmation while `Enter`, `Esc`, or `n` continues recording.
- Use arrow glyphs such as `↑/↓` and `←/→` in on-screen shortcut guidance. In `PROCESSES`, MEM, GPU, NW/DISK, and CPU, indicate a registered Graph by coloring the metric value instead of reserving cells for its slot ordinal; use bold only for the active Graph value.
- Clickable controls outside modal dialogs must change to the shared focus-surface background and bold text while hovered by the mouse; hover must not reuse warning or destructive selection colors.
- Format shortcut guidance inside confirmation dialogs exactly like the screen footer: show each key first and its action label in the normal text style, then separate different actions with two spaces. Group keys that perform the same action with `/`, such as `Enter/Esc Close` or `Enter/Esc/n Continue`. In warning-border dialogs, render every key group in the warning color and bold text so the key color matches the border; do not reserve that style only for the affirmative action. Do not use prose-like slash-separated sentences such as `Enter selects / Esc cancels`.
- Complete controls and contextual UI behavior belong in Help, Footer, tests, and implementation. The README covers only the controls required for first use and links to in-app Help for the complete reference. Metric definitions and feature-design invariants belong in their canonical documents under `docs/`.
- When changing controls or UI behavior, update Help, Footer, tests, actual key handling, and the owning design document as applicable. Update the README only when its first-use workflow or description of a major capability changes.

## Implementation Review Points

- Compute drawing regions and mouse hit-test regions from the same helpers and conditions. If Graph / Samples visibility, Delta visibility, or multiple slots make drawing and input regions diverge, clicks and cursor lines will break.
- When Graph and Samples operate on the same concept, check for missing key-operation parity. For example, sample cursor movement should have matching meanings for Home / End / PageUp / PageDown / Left / Right in both Samples and Graph.
- Do not confuse "nearby sample" with "sample that actually exists at that time." Cursor movement and mouse selection may choose a nearby sample, but Graph should show a value only when that Graph has a sample at the same captured time.
- For multiple Graphs, separate shared state from slot-specific state clearly. Time span, A/B points, and cursor age may be shared, but Y-axis scale, sample availability, and value labels must be checked independently per Graph.

## Testing and Verification

- After Rust changes, run `cargo test` whenever practical.
- Do not require every test to run merely because a branch was pushed. Choose verification based on the risk and scope of the change.
- If normal build or test commands fail because the executable is locked, consider using a separate target directory such as `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=target/codex-build`.
- For UI changes, consider whether existing `TestBackend` drawing tests or buffer snapshot tests can cover the behavior.
- When a specification changes, also check whether `README.ja.md` and `README.md` need updates.

## Commands

Use PowerShell / Windows-oriented commands.

```powershell
cargo test
cargo build
cargo run --release
```

Reproduce the dependency audit workflow with the pinned audit tool and the committed `Cargo.lock`:

```powershell
cargo install cargo-audit --version 0.22.2 --locked
cargo audit
```

The regular dependency workflow runs when `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`, or the workflow changes, on a weekly schedule, and on manual dispatch. It fails on known vulnerabilities without making every advisory warning a merge blocker. Release-candidate verification uses the stricter `cargo audit --deny warnings` gate before packaging.

Use focused tests or `cargo test <name>` when appropriate.
